ASP.NET Core Identity

ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system. It allows us to create, read, update and delete user accounts. Supports account confirmation, authentication, authorisation, password recovery, two-factor authentication with SMS. It also supports external login providers like Microsoft, Facebook, Google etc. We will discuss implementing these features in our upcoming videos in this series.
