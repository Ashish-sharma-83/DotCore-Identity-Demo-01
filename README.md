ASP.NET Core Identity:

1. Is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality.
2. Manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more.
Users can create an account with the login information stored in Identity or they can use an external login provider. Supported external login providers include Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter.

Authentication And Authorization In ASP.NET Core:
Authentication is the process of validating user credentials and authorization is the process of checking privileges for a user to access specific modules in an application. In this article, we will see how to protect an ASP.NET Core Web API application by implementing JWT authentication. We will also see how to use authorization in ASP.NET Core to provide access to various functionality of the application. We will store user credentials in an SQL server database and we will use Entity framework and Identity framework for database operations.
