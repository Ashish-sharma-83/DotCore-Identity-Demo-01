ASP.NET Core Identity:

1. Is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality.
2. Manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more.
Users can create an account with the login information stored in Identity or they can use an external login provider. Supported external login providers include Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter.

For information on how to globally require all users to be authenticated, see Require authenticated users.
